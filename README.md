# parallel_enhanced_sampling

Trialing OpenMM-based REST2 (or eventually others) enhanced sampling schemes. Using Ray to parallelize replica runs and communicate. 

Definitely not complete - would be nice to have logging and saving capabilities, plus, well a lot more! I just don't appear to be getting time to work on it.
...And I doubt ill be able to return to it myself. So would rather share with others =)
