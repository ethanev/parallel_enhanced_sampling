# parallel_enhanced_sampling

OpenMM-based classic replica exchange, REST2 and a not yet totally working BE-META enhanced sampling schemes. Using Ray to parallelize replica runs and communicate and not python multiprocessing or openMPI! 

Definitely not complete (sorry) - would be nice to have logging and saving capabilities, plus, well a lot more!  

I just don't appear to be getting time to work on it...And I doubt ill be able to return to it myself. So would rather share with others =)
